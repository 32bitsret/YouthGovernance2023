# Building a model for youth governance in Plateau State.

Permanent structures owned by communities are strongly advised, the structures must paint the pan African dream. Deliberately designed with African Art, Africa aesthetics which is intended to build the long lost patriotism in our people.

This space will be in charge of documenting the history of that community, language preservation through visual arts, drama, African poetry, Music. Serve as an entry point for tourist into the community. Also document individual, government and private sector effort at building their community.

This structure is a think tank, the ight house, the aluta square of the community aimed at bringing  together people (children, women and men) to participate in, contribute to and benefit from growth processes in ways that recognises the value of their contributions, respect their dignity and make it possible to negotiate a fairer distribution of the benefits of growth.

It can also serve as a town hall meeting spot between people, people and government to brainstorm on ideas that will proffer solution to issues facing their community.
